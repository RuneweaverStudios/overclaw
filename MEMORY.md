# MEMORY.md - Long-Term General Knowledge

## Skills Naming Conventions

*   **GitHub repo:** `RuneweaverStudios/agent-swarm` (skill name: Agent Swarm).
*   **Public/User-Facing Name:** `Agent Swarm | Less Tokens, More Results` (ClawHub slug: `agent-swarm`, e.g. `clawhub.ai/RuneweaverStudios/agent-swarm`). Friday-router and intent-router were removed as redundant; single skill is agent-swarm.

When preparing external communications or user-facing copy, use "Agent Swarm | Less Tokens, More Results" (or the short form "Agent Swarm") and the ClawHub link.

**ClawHub:** Old ClawHub is being replaced. When the new instance is live, update the ClawHub base URL and slugs everywhere (MEMORY, TOOLS, AGENTS, skills READMEs/SKILLs, PUSH_SKILLS, orchestrator rule).
