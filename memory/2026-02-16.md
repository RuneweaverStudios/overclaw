### OpenClaw Backup
- Successfully created a `tar.gz` archive of `~/.openclaw` (excluding node_modules, .venv, .git, logs) named `openclaw_backup_20260216_041307.tar.gz` on Desktop after `zip` command failed. User instructed to manually transfer to USB and restore on new Mac Mini.

### `gateway-guard` Skill
- Discussed plans to enhance `gateway-guard` to detect and recommend fixes for `exec` host configuration and node connectivity/capability issues, as identified during `remindctl` (`exec host not allowed`/`node requires system.run`) and `Firefox.dmg` download attempts.
- Skill tester (`skill-tester`) reported `gateway-guard` failed test due to `secret_not_detectable` reason.

### `project-manager-agent` Skill
- Created `project-manager-agent` skill to monitor sub-agents.
- Developed `project_manager.py` to identify stalled/failed sub-agents.
- Configured a cron job to run `project_manager.py` every 5 minutes to provide status updates.

### `agent-swarm` (formerly `Friday Router`) Skill
- User reported concerns about `Friday Router`'s routing. Clarified that `friday-router-1` (v1.6.2) in Downloads was older than `agent-swarm` (v1.7.0) in workspace, so no update needed from Downloads.
- **Critical Development**: Began implementing dynamic `exec` host management into `agent-swarm/scripts/router.py` to handle switching between `sandbox` and `node` seamlessly.
    - Injected `get_current_openclaw_config()` helper function.
    - Modified `spawn_agent` to return recommendations for `config.patch` if there's an `exec` host mismatch.
    - **Encountered persistent `SyntaxError`s in `router.py`'s `main()` function** due to improper handling of multi-line strings in `print` statements, preventing script execution. This is the immediate blocking issue for `agent-swarm`.

### System Issues
- **OpenRouter Key Limit Exceeded**: The newly created `Project Manager (Sub-agent Monitor)` cron job has started failing with a `403 Key limit exceeded` error from OpenRouter, preventing sub-agent monitoring. User advised to check OpenRouter key settings.
